Spaceship Decimus is broken and it's up to you to collect the missing pieces, put it together, and fly back to your planet! To exit each maze level, use the arrow keys to move around collect all the available pieces. After five maze levels, use the arrow keys to fly your ship and use the spacebar to shoot! Watch out for aliens and asteroids though, they could kill you!

Future Steps:
There are a lot of polish related things that could be explored in the future. 
For example, screens between levels, and a win screen with a restart option. 
In addition, some things could be implemented on a gameplay level like indicating when powerups run out. 
Also, the game save levels aren't very communicative with the maze levels, in that it should save how many pieces have been picked up in previous levels.

Notes:
We reduced the hitbox of the aliens to make the levels easier to play and thus easier to test. In addition, we reduced the number of saucers for the spaceship to kill.
